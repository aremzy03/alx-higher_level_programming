Text Indentation
================
``text_indentation()`` takes any given text as argument the checks for a delimiter character
then it adds two new line after each delimiter character
The delimiter characters in this function are:
period (.)
the colon (:)
and the question mark (?)
Example:
::
    >>> text_indentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("Hey Bro? What's up.")
    Hey Bro?
    <BLANKLINE>
    What's up.
    <BLANKLINE>

The ``text_indentation()`` function strictly only accepts strings as an argument, in the 
case where a wrong type is passed, a Traceback error is returned
Example:
::
    >>> text_indentation(200)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text must be a string
