===========================
The matrix_divided function
===========================

The ``matrix_divided`` module holds the ``matrix_divided()``

The ``matrix_divided()`` functions divides each integers or floating points by a given value and returns
a new matrix contain its results

Example:
::
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__("2-matrix_divided").matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [
    ... [1, 2, 3],
    ... [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

The ``matrix_divided()`` can work for matrices of any size as long as it is a valid matrix
::
    >>> matrix2 = [
    ... [2, 4, 6, 8 ,10],
    ... [4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
    ... [6, 12, 24, 48, 96]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix2, 2)
    [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], [2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0], [3.0, 6.0, 12.0, 24.0, 48.0]]

In the case where the matrix is invalid,an error returns and this can happen 
if the program encounters one of the following:
- The matrix is a list containaining lists
::
    >>> matrix3 = 5
    >>> matrix_divided(5, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

- The length of the matrix's lists are not equivalent
::
    >>> matrix4 = [
    ... [1, 2, 3],
    ... [4, 5]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix4, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

- Each element in the lists are not integers or floating points
::
    >>> matrix5 = [
    ... [1, 3, "hello"],
    ... [2, 6, "hello world!"]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix5, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Also, the divisor should as well be either an int or a float.
::
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, "hello")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: div must be a number

And absolutely cannot be zero(0).
::
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
